# Mediately Code Challenge -- Backend

### Requirements

You need to have working environment on your machine:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) -- or you can use npm if you are more used with it

### Installation

- Clone repository to your computer
- Run command in backend subfolder `yarn install`
- Run command in backend subfolder `node index.js`

You should see message:
`ðŸš€ Server running on: http://localhost:8888`

At that point you can create a call to backend from your terminal or Postman:

`curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8888/'`

You should see response `{"message":"Hi!"}`.

Now you are ready to take React frontend challenge.
